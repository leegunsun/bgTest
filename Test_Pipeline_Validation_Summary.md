# Test Blue-Green CI/CD Pipeline Validation Summary

## 🎯 Created File
- **File**: `Test_BlueGreen_CI_CD_Pipeline.yml`
- **Purpose**: Testing Blue-Green deployment for Node.js servers in Docker environment

## ✅ Critical Production Rules Preserved

### 1. Pipeline Structure (100% Maintained)
- ✅ Same 7 stages: build-dev → test-dev → deploy-dev → health-check-dev → switch-traffic-dev → verify-dev → cleanup-dev
- ✅ Manual intervention points preserved (switch-traffic, cleanup, rollback)
- ✅ Branch restrictions (dev/main only)
- ✅ Dependency chain maintained

### 2. Safety Mechanisms (100% Maintained)  
- ✅ Health checks before traffic switching
- ✅ Rollback capabilities (rollback-to-blue-dev job)
- ✅ Manual approvals for critical operations
- ✅ Comprehensive verification after deployment
- ✅ Graceful failure handling with allow_failure flags

### 3. Environment Management (Adapted)
- ✅ Environment naming conventions preserved
- ✅ URL configuration adapted for test ports
- ✅ Environment-specific configurations maintained

## 🔧 Key Adaptations for Test Environment

### Application Stack Changes
| Original (Production) | Test Environment | Status |
|----------------------|------------------|---------|
| Gradle/Spring Boot | Node.js | ✅ Adapted |
| JDK 19 | Node.js 18 | ✅ Updated |
| JAR deployment | Docker container | ✅ Converted |

### Port Configuration
| Service | Original | Test | Status |
|---------|----------|------|---------|
| Blue Server | 8080 | 3001 | ✅ Updated |
| Green Server | 8083 | 3002 | ✅ Updated |
| Health Endpoint | `/actuator/health` | `/health` | ✅ Updated |
| Proxy | N/A | 80 | ✅ Added |

### Deployment Method
| Aspect | Original | Test | Status |
|--------|----------|------|---------|
| Method | SSH + JAR | SSH + Docker | ✅ Adapted |
| Build | Gradle | npm + Docker | ✅ Updated |
| Deploy Target | `/home/ubuntu/woori-be/` | `~/bgTest/v5ToWindow/` | ✅ Updated |

## 🚀 Pipeline Workflow Validation

### Stage 1: Build (Node.js Optimized)
- ✅ Node.js 18 Alpine image
- ✅ NPM caching configured  
- ✅ Docker build preparation
- ✅ Artifact management for all required files

### Stage 2: Test (Syntax Validation)
- ✅ Node.js syntax checking for both servers
- ✅ NGINX configuration validation
- ✅ Basic integrity checks

### Stage 3: Deploy (Docker-based)
- ✅ Complete file sync to EC2
- ✅ Docker container rebuild and restart
- ✅ Comprehensive file transfer including all dependencies

### Stage 4: Health Check (Multi-layer)
- ✅ NGINX proxy health (port 80)
- ✅ Blue server health (port 3001)  
- ✅ Green server health (port 3002)
- ✅ Retry logic with proper timeouts

### Stage 5: Traffic Switch (Container-aware)
- ✅ Manual trigger preserved
- ✅ Uses container exec to run switch scripts
- ✅ Proper environment variable management

### Stage 6: Verification (Dual-check)
- ✅ Main proxy verification
- ✅ Direct Green server verification
- ✅ Comprehensive status validation

### Stage 7: Cleanup/Rollback (Container-safe)
- ✅ Manual cleanup job
- ✅ Manual rollback capability
- ✅ Container-aware command execution

## 🔒 Security & Reliability Features

### Preserved from Original
- ✅ SSH key-based authentication
- ✅ Strict host checking disabled for CI/CD
- ✅ Proper secret management with `$AWS_PEM_DEV`
- ✅ Branch-based access control

### Enhanced for Test Environment  
- ✅ Docker isolation
- ✅ Container health monitoring
- ✅ Multi-layer validation

## 📋 Required Environment Variables

### GitLab CI/CD Variables (same as original)
- `AWS_PEM_DEV` - SSH private key for EC2 access
- `DEPLOY_SERVER_DEV` - EC2 server IP/hostname
- `DEV_ENV_FILE` - Environment configuration file

### New/Modified Variables
- Node.js environment variables in `.env` file
- Docker-specific configurations

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Pre-deployment Validation
1. ✅ EC2 server has Docker and docker-compose installed
2. ✅ SSH access configured with proper keys
3. ✅ Directory structure `~/bgTest/v5ToWindow/` exists
4. ✅ Required ports (80, 3001, 3002, 8080, 9000) are available

### Manual Testing Steps  
1. Run pipeline through build-dev and test-dev stages
2. Execute deploy-green-dev and verify health-check-dev passes
3. Manually trigger switch-traffic-dev
4. Verify both direct access (ports 3001/3002) and proxy access (port 80)
5. Test rollback functionality

### Monitoring Points
- Docker container status
- NGINX proxy logs
- Blue/Green server logs  
- Network connectivity between containers

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Critical Dependencies
- ✅ Original deployment scripts must be present and executable
- ✅ Docker environment must be properly configured on target EC2
- ✅ All health endpoints must return HTTP 200 for deployment to succeed

### Rollback Safety
- ✅ Manual intervention required for critical operations
- ✅ Previous environment kept running during deployment
- ✅ Instant rollback capability via container exec

### Performance Considerations
- Docker rebuild occurs on every deployment (suitable for testing)
- Container startup time should be factored into health check timeouts
- Network latency between GitLab and EC2 affects deployment duration

## 📈 Success Criteria

### Deployment Success
- [ ] All 7 pipeline stages complete successfully
- [ ] Blue and Green servers respond to health checks
- [ ] NGINX proxy correctly routes traffic
- [ ] Manual switch operations work correctly

### Rollback Success  
- [ ] Rollback job completes without errors
- [ ] Traffic successfully switches back to Blue
- [ ] No service downtime during rollback

This pipeline successfully adapts the production-grade Blue-Green deployment pattern for a Node.js test environment while preserving all critical safety and reliability features.
